The testscript_praw.py file is pretty much the same one Valery referenced last week during our meeting, now we'll have a copy on our repository. There's more than can be added to this one to where comments on a post can be searched as well. 

I have been working on another one today, testscript2_no_praw, which I think will give better options to search all of Reddit by keyword as opposed to having to specify a subbreddit. This is from a tutorial that came from the same source as the above but I haven not gotten this one to work yet. I keep getting an error reading: 

{'error': 400, 'message': 'Bad Request'}

this has something to do with the access token.
